This page lists libraries for visualizing data in Python.  If you see any missing Python tools, please open a [PR](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) for [tools.yml](https://github.com/pyviz/pyviz.org/blob/master/tools/tools.yml). Tools are sorted in each category according to their total downloads per month when added to the list. Note that conda downloads are computed by summing total downloads across the defaults channel, conda-forge, and bioconda; data for other channels is not currently included. Also note that the stars, contributors, license and PyPi downloads badges are cached to prevent users to hit the badges rate limits. Since caching can fail occasionally for some PyPi downloads badges, their live counterpart is instead displayed and can be identified by their grey background.
