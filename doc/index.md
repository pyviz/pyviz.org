# How to visualize data in Python

Welcome to PyViz!  PyViz is an effort to make data visualization using Python open-source tools easier to use, easier to learn, and more powerful.

This PyViz.org website contains:

 - [Overviews](overviews/index.html) of the OSS visualization packages available in Python, how they relate to each other, and the core concepts that underlie them
 - [High-level tools](high-level/index.html) for getting started with Python viz, creating powerful plots in just a few lines of code
 - [All tools](tools.html) available for doing viz in Python OSS, as a table for comparing maturity, popularity, and support.
 - [Dashboarding](dashboarding/index.html) tools for sharing live Python-backed visualizations
 - [SciVis](scivis/index.html) tools for rendering data embedded in three-dimensional space
 - [Tutorials](tutorials/index.html) showing how to use the available tools to accomplish various categories of tasks
 - [Topic examples](htts://examples.pyviz.org) of using Python viz tools to analyze or describe specific datasets in a particular domain or field of research

## This site
If you are a part of the Python data visualization landscape, then this is _your_ site!  All content has been contributed by individual library authors and users, and you could be next! Please open an issue or PR on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/pyviz/website) to start a conversation. The goal is to make everyone doing viz in Python more productive, have more power, and make a greater impact from their work.

**NOTE:** Some of the material previously hosted on this site is now at [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org) and is linked from the "HoloViz" section of the Tutorials heading on this site.
