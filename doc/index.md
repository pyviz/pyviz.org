# Python tools for data visualization

Welcome to PyViz!  The PyViz.org website is an open platform for helping users decide on the best open-source (OSS) Python data visualization tools for their purposes, with links, overviews, comparisons, and examples. Contents:

 - [Overviews](overviews/index.html) of the OSS visualization packages available in Python, how they relate to each other, and the core concepts that underlie them.
 - [High-level tools](high-level/index.html) for getting started with Python viz, creating powerful plots in just a few lines of code.
 - [All tools](tools.html) available for doing viz in Python OSS, as a live table for comparing maturity, popularity, and support.
 - [Dashboarding](dashboarding/index.html) tools for sharing live Python-backed visualizations.
 - [SciVis](scivis/index.html) tools for rendering data embedded in three-dimensional space.
 - [Tutorials](tutorials/index.html) showing how to use the available tools to accomplish various categories of tasks.
 - [Topic examples](https://examples.pyviz.org) of using Python viz tools to analyze or describe specific datasets in a particular domain or field of research.

## This site

If you are a part of the Python data visualization landscape, then this is _your_ site!  All content has been contributed by individual library authors and users, and you could be next! Please open an issue or PR on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/pyviz/website) to start a conversation. The goal is to make everyone doing viz in Python more productive, have more power, and make a greater impact from their work.

**NOTE:** The contents of PyViz.org from June 2019 or earlier, focusing on Datashader, HoloViews, GeoViews, Panel, Param, and hvPlot, are now at [HoloViz.org](https://holoviz.org). PyViz.org is now a fully open guide to all Python visualization tools. If you are looking for Brian Thomas's
