# Tutorials

Most of the projects listed at PyViz.org contain examples explaining how to solve various problems using that specific tool. This section lists additional in-depth, comprehensive tutorials designed for users new to Python viz, helping them to get started with a variety of different types of plot and situations. Each tutorial should include at least an hour's worth of work, with links to a repository of runnable materials along with text to describe what to do.

- [Bokeh tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bokeh/bokeh-notebooks/blob/master/tutorial/00%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Setup.ipynb): How to use the native [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) API directly to create interactive plots, apps, and dashboards.

- [HoloViz tutorial](https://holoviz.org/tutorial): How to use the high-level [HoloViz](http://holoviz.org) tools from Anaconda to plot gridded, tabular, streaming, large, and graph/network data, focusing on [Panel](https://panel.pyviz.org), [Datashader](http://datashader.org), [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org), [GeoViews](http://geoviews.org), and [hvPlot](https://hvplot.pyviz.org), which buildion [Bokeh](http://bokeh.org) and [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org).
