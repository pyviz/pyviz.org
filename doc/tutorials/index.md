# Tutorials

Tutorials are sets of executable files (normally notebooks) that build on
each other and build understanding. They should have exercises and describe
architecture as it is encountered.


 - [Bokeh](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bokeh/bokeh-notebooks/master?filepath=tutorial%2F00%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Setup.ipynb): an interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and to extend this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.
 - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/tutorials/index.html): a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.
 - [HoloViz](https://pyviz.org/tutorial): high-level tools that make it easier to apply Python plotting libraries to your data. Includes Panel, Datashader, Holoviews, Geoviews, and hvplot.
