### PyViz Tools

This repository is used to generate a tools dashboard that allows statuses for various
services to be shown for all pyviz-related packages.

The main configuration of the dashboard is done via the ``tools.yml`` file,
which can contain several sections with a list of packages, and a list of services for each
section.

The dashboard can be seen [here](http://pyviz.org/tools)
