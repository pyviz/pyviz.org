Source material to build [pyviz.org](https://pyviz.org).  This site is owned by [NumFocus](https://numfocus.org) and is currently managed by Anaconda, Inc. for the community, but is open to everyone involved in Python data visualization; see [#2](https://github.com/pyviz/website/issues/2).

## Building pyviz.org

Whenever a PR is merged, or a commit is pushed to master, a Github Actions job is triggered that builds pyviz.org.

## Building dev site

To build the [dev site](https://pyviz-dev.github.io/pyviz.org), just push a commit containing the string: `website_dev`. This will start a job on Github Actions that when complete will deploy to the dev site.

**NOTE:** This will work on any branch, so it is recommended that you use it to test builds on PRs, just try not to trample on other people's toes.

## Building website locally

Install anaconda-project:

```bash
conda install anaconda-project
```

Build the cached badges:

```bash
anaconda-project build_cache
```

Build the website:

```bash
anaconda-project build_website
```

View the website locally:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

## Adding a tool to the "All Tools" page

See the [README](tools/README.md) in the tools directory for instructions on adding a tool to the "All Tools" page.
